# asynchronous_aging

Successful pregnancies require fine coordination among the reproductive organs. Reproductive research has focused on ovarian ageing, whereas the uterus and oviduct have received considerably less attention; whether these organs age synchronously with the ovaries remains unclear. Here, we established a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the ovary, oviduct, and uterus throughout the murine reproductive lifespan. Organâ€“organ communication patterns were identified using cell-specific hormone receptor analysis. Ageing hallmarks, including DNA damage, cellular senescence, and apoptosis, were evaluated for each cell type. Analysis of these ageing-related gene set scores combined with changes in morphology and molecular signatures revealed that the ovary aged earlier and faster than the oviduct and uterus; this was also confirmed in human reproductive tissues. Our single-cell transcriptomic atlas provides molecular insights into reproductive ageing and its asynchronisation for the reproductive organs throughout the murine reproductive lifespan; this atlas may reveal the causes of declining fertility at advanced ages.
